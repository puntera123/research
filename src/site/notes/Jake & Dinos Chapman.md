I found Jake and Dinos Chapman's work interesting in its grotesque imagery and dark humour about historical atrocities.
Many of their pieces dialogue with the body as an object of consumption, altering it to the point of the monstrous, but very striking. Even though I haven't found much about his works individually, I have heard an interview with him and I liked this sentence very much <span style="color:rgb(192, 0, 0)">“London’s art scene is now full of vibrant young people who all get drunk together and sleep together,”</span> quoted from [Norman Rosenthal](https://www.artnet.com/magazineus/news/nathan/jake-chapman-sir-norman-rosenthal-10-31-11.asp) while talking to Jake.![[CHAPMAN, J & D (1997) *Doggy*   2.pdf]][CHAPMAN, J & D (1997) *Doggy*](https://www.invaluable.com/auction-lot/jake-and-dinos-chapman-uk-1962-1966-doggy-1997-fi-1-c-3d94ec69b4)  

The exhibition entitled ‘Zygotic Acceleration, Biogenetic, De-Sublimated Libidinal Model’ has been the one that has stuck in my head the most, where the brothers melded naked child mannequins together and their noses and mouths were replaced with genitals and they are wearing nothing but Nike trainers, supposedly a representation of child consumerism.
Although this show was quickly cancelled.
