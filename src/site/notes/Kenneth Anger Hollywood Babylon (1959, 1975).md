This book caught my attention because it is a recapitulation of the perversions of the film industry, <span style="color:rgb(192, 0, 0)">a catalogue of decadence disguised as glamour,</span> a bit similar to what I want to do in my project but with the fashion industry. The author's intention is to dismantle the beauty of Hollywood, exposing all the networks of sex, power and manipulation that sustain its structure.

I'm drawn to how the bawdy tone of the book works, and it's not just a chronicle. <span style="color:rgb(192, 0, 0)">How Anger turns gossip and morbidity into weapons of criticism and exposure. I want to transfer that approach to fashion: to show how sex appeal and promotion are not just strategies, but the real rules of the game. </span>
