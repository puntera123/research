Helmut Newton, *47 nudes* (Introduction by Karl Largerfeld)

It caught my attention because it shows a power play between domination and submission, where the body becomes an object of desire and control.

<span style="color:rgb(192, 0, 0)">the 'once-only-ness', of a moment, he takes the same picture twice: the value and meaning of the first is demonstrated by the differences in the second, despite every pain taken in the reconstruction.</span>

What interests me is how, throughout this series of photographs, Newton explores the vulnerability of the naked body and how he fuses it with the imposing presence of the models' gaze and the light of day. In this play of contrasts, the fragility of the body is transformed into a symbol of power that challenges the traditional perception of nudity in fashion photography.
