I was interested in exploring the meaning of men's rings, I knew they symbolised power, but I wanted to justify this deduction, the first thing that came to my mind were those portraits of kings and figures of power surrounded by wealth and rings.

I ended up coming across the article [‘Men's rings and their place in style history’](https://couturenotebook.com/best-haute-couture-blog/mens-rings-and-history). This article narrates how<span style="color:rgb(192, 0, 0)"> historically, rings on men's hands have functioned as symbols of status or belonging to specific groups, from the religious to the marginal</span> where in certain contexts they were seen as effeminate or linked to criminals.
During the article, Yves Gastou, antique dealer and collector, is interviewed. Gastou considers men's rings as deeply sensual, almost erotic objects, loaded with meaning. He created a book collecting all kinds of rings from all kinds of eras, and shows how these objects reflect the identity, power and desire of those who wear them.

I am particularly interested in this approach for my project, as the rings can function as material <span style="color:rgb(192, 0, 0)">symbols to reinforce the dynamics of power and hierarchy between the characters in my narrative.</span>
