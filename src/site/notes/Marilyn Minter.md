Marilyn Minter's work has caught my attention because of the <span style="color:rgb(192, 0, 0)">way she manages to capture details and suggest sexual situations without explicitly showing them.</span> Her close focus on body parts, textures and fluids makes me feel on the borderline between the beautiful and the uncomfortable.

In my opinion, all this makes his message more powerful: <span style="color:rgb(192, 0, 0)">there is no complete image, but a series of visual clues that invite the imagination and almost function as a psychological work.  </span>
  
I am interested in using this ability to insinuate, to build tension from detail in my project. I'm not interested in stating the message explicitly, but in making the <span style="color:rgb(192, 0, 0)">viewer stop to think and question by themselves.</span>
