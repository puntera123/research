I am interested in how Lee Chapman captures the culture of alcohol in Japan in a very raw way, which is different from most of the images we see of men in suits. I am interested in exploring this "afterparty" look in my project, where drinking alcohol is part of the culture of bonding and networking this photo for me wold be "afternetworking".
