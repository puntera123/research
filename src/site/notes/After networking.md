[Lee Chapman](https://www.boredpanda.com/drunk-japanese-photography-lee-chapman/)

I am interested in how Lee Chapman captures the culture of alcohol in Japan in a very raw way, which is different from most of the images we see of men in suits. <span style="color:rgb(192, 0, 0)">I am interested in exploring this "afterparty" look in my project,</span> where drinking alcohol is part of the culture of bonding and networking this photo for me wold be "afternetworking".
