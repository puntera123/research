Klaus Kertess *Animals and Nudes*: Peter Hujar


In the book Animals and Nudes, Peter Hujar shows a particular sensitivity towards the bodies in his photographs, moving away from drama or any attempt at spectacularity. I am interested in his images because they do not seek to provoke from the obvious, but invite us to recognise a silent beauty.  
  
His photographs interest me because they do not need colour; they work from the essence. Through the subject and the composition,<span style="color:rgb(192, 0, 0)"> Hujar suggests a gaze charged with presence and vulnerability that, on its own, is capable of telling the whole story.</span>
