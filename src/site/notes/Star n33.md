[Star 33 (1978)](https://archive.org/details/star_bcn_33/page/n19/mode/2up)

Star (1974-1980) was a Spanish underground magazine that emerged in the post-Franco transition. It was an epicentre of punk aesthetics and fused sex, drugs and anarchy with a scathing observation of Spanish society.

What has interested me about Star is how he used satire comics to demolish the myths of the newly born democracy. In between articles about music and culture they add short comics with a dirty, grotesque line that seem ridiculous to expose the uglyness in the social problems of the moment. For me it seems like a very powerful tool to tell stories, which could be cancelled if they were serious, but by adding this satirical touch it doesn't allow them to be judged as a direct attack. 

I want to implement these satirical strips in my project where I describe short scenes to degrade the romanticism placed on the fashion industry and criticise the use of sex as a bargaining chip.
