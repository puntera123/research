**What is the subject?**
	‘Fashion, Sex and Promotion’ addresses, in a satirical tone, the dynamics of power in fashion: how networking translates into intimate relationships and how sexual attraction is used as a bargaining chip to climb the career ladder. I aim to demolish the apparent glamour and reveal, in an ironic way, the hidden practices behind fame and success in this medium.	

**Why am I interested in this?**
	The motivation stems from the experience of how, in the fashion industry, talent and creativity often take a back seat to personal contacts and favors.

**What is the aim? What do I want to effect / change? And why am I motivated towards this? Why? i.e. particular skill or expertise, effective in reaching intended audience?**
	I want to employ irony and “dark humor” in order to expose and question the system that prioritizes superficial and utilitarian relationships. I would like to make fun of the practices of intimate relationships in the fashion world, breaking down the glamour myth and making the public- on the arbitrariness of professional promotion based on sexual favors and personal contacts.

**What materials and processes might be involved in achieving your aim?**
	To achieve my goal, I will use elements that symbolise easy money, power and superficiality. In an indirect and burlesque way, I will incorporate subtle details through methods such as textile creation and printing techniques, which hint at the existence of sexual relationships in this context.  
	I will also redesign typical office garments representing networking and the business world to show what would be the new form of networking. Through the manipulation of fabrics such as elastic, leather and tweed, I will seek to generate textures and visual effects that reinforce the concept of power and superficiality of the fashion industry.  
	In addition, I want to develop a more performative side, I want to create storylines and characters that represent different roles within these power relationships.

What is the intended Impact? What do I hope the project will achieve?
	What motivates me to develop this project is the idea of Dadaist anti-art and how they used art to criticise the arts, so I want to use fashion as a means to criticise fashion.  
	I want to show the viewer in an ironic and raw way how ‘power’ and contacts often trump talent, and how sexuality is used as a tool for promotion within the fashion world.  
	Generate discussion about internal corruption in the industry and question the validity of traditional methods of achieving success.
