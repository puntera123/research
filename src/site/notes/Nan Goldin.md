Nan Goldin, *The devilÂ´s Playground*: Clemens lighting Jens' cigarette (Paris, 2001)


What always attracts me to Nan Goldin's work is the transparency with which she narrates both her personal life and her surroundings. Her images are not composed from an aesthetic distance, but neither do they interfere with the scene, <span style="color:rgb(192, 0, 0)">documenting human relationships without idealisation.  </span>
<span style="color:rgb(192, 0, 0)">For my work I am interested in observing the way in which friends/lovers/strangers interact, where sexual attraction plays a large part in these interactions,</span> a recurring theme in Goldin's photographs.
