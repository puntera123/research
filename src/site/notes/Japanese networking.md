[Pawe≈Ç Jaszczuk - High Fashion](https://www.artsy.net/show/photo-edition-berlin-pawel-jaszczuk-high-fashion-in-japan-haihuatusiyon-ri-ben)

Pawel Jaszcuk's photographs have caught my interest because it is interesting to see how other artists approach the subject of networking in other industries, how he explores the culture of alcohol in ==Japan and how drinking is considered almost as part of the working day to create bonds with your colleagues.== 
I find the visuals of the photographs very visually entertaining, how it captures a static moment that at the same time conveys so much movement.
