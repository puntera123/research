[Pawe≈Ç Jaszczuk - High Fashion](https://www.artsy.net/show/photo-edition-berlin-pawel-jaszczuk-high-fashion-in-japan-haihuatusiyon-ri-ben)

Pawel Jaszcuk's photographs have caught my interest because it is interesting to see how other artists <span style="color:rgb(192, 0, 0)">approach the subject of networking in other industries.</span> How he explores the culture of alcohol in Japan and how drinking is considered almost as part of the working day to create bonds with your colleagues. 
<span style="color:rgb(192, 0, 0)">I find the visuals of the photographs very visually entertaining, how it captures a static moment that at the same time conveys so much movement.</span>
