Cindy Sherman

I am interested in exploring how power dynamics are represented in sexual relationships. That is why I find Cindy Sherman's photographs so provocative, they allow me to talk about how the <span style="color:rgb(192, 0, 0)">fashion industry turns people into disposable objects, into a sexual toy and uses their bodies as a bargaining chip.</span> Through these photographs, I can visually represent these dyadic relationships where <span style="color:rgb(192, 0, 0)">objectification, dominance and interest</span> play a big role.
