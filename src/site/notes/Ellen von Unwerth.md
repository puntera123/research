[Ellen von Unwerth, *Bees Do It* (Paris, 2012)](https://www.artnet.com/artists/ellen-von-unwerth/bees-do-it-paris-a-6owkeWR1NwVGVG6LaYpYqg2)

Ellen von Unwerth's images particularly appeal to me because of her ability to capture moments of apparent disorder and agitation, but static, almost like the time was frozed, giving the scenes an almost cinematic character. 
What fascinates me most is the way her images convey the sensation of being ‘caught’ in the middle of a scene, as when something unexpected happens and, for a moment, everything stops in your mind.
