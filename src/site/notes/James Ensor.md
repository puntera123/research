I find James Ensor's work very interesting because of the way he uses absurdity and irony as tools to expose the vices and contradictions of society. <span style="color:rgb(192, 0, 0)">The way he ridicules authority, religion, the bourgeoisie through grotesque masks and skulls.</span>

The way in which he manages to show the most false, human and absurd side of society it gave me a lot to reflect about.
